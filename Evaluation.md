# Package Reliability Evaluation

To evaluate software reliability:

- Checked npm pages for each dependency:
  - **express, ejs, express-ejs-layouts, dotenv, helmet, morgan**
  - All have millions of weekly downloads and active maintenance.
- Verified all licenses (MIT or ISC).
- Ran `npm audit` → no high-severity vulnerabilities.
- Checked recent commits and issue activity on GitHub.
